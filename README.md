# Honours Project: Robert Duncan Brady (Hon_proj_RDB)
Record of work Completed as part of Robert Bradys Honors project as part of the Vafaee Lab(UNSW). Project is focused on the downstream analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics Data.
# Supervisory Team
This project is being conducted as collaborative effort between Vafaee Lab and AliveX under the guidance and supervision of Associate Professor Fatemeh Vafaee, Dr Nona Farbehi. Robert will also working closely alongside Mehran Piran.
# Project Description
The field of Spatial transcriptomics has seen major development in recent years providing new opportunities for Transcriptomic analysis techniques. This project seeks to leverage the newly available spatial information from spatial transcriptomic technologies to explore the prediction and analysis of cell-cell communication using machine learning techniques.
# Project Scope
This project explores the application of Graph Neural Networks to Spatial Transcriptomic data within the context of Cellular communication analysis. All data being examined is sourced from Spatial Transcriptomic technologies, specifically MERfish and Seqfish datasets. 
# Aims
The goals of the project are to explore the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks at prediction of cell-cell interaction when treated as a link prediction task for Spatial transcriptomic data. In order to do so the following considerations will be addressed
- The inclusion of cellular distance and cell type as edge level features in the cellular graph representation
- The application of Graph Attention Mechanisms in link prediction for Cellular Graphs
- The application of Edge-Featured Graph attention Networks in link prediction
