# Spatial Transcriptomics pipeline
## Goals
The basic outline of what I should do for each pipeline to familiarise myself with ST data from hybridised and insitu-sequencing technologies

1. Download the data
2. Load the data in to python object/dataframe for analysis
3. perform analysis and visualisation of the data

Things that I should look into how to do with ST data

1. Normalise the data
2. Align the data
3. Deconvolution 
4. Cell type annotation
5. Cluster Analysis

With each pipeline I should aim to mostly cover the same analysis techniques, but potentially explore the differences within each pipeline.
  - To explore difference maybe I should use different analysis tools to look at each.

## Stretch Goal
Create an additional notebook that does more of a comparison between the two technologies and capabilities
Using the same framework for each.
