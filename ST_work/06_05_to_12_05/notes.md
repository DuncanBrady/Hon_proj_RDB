## Task Notes
### Meeting With John
The meeting with john was productive in providing insights on how geneRain could be applied to my work.
The key take aways from the meeting were as follows.
- GeneRain being trained on bulk RNA samples is likely to prove an issue but I can explore it
- John suggests that I should use the 'Bining by gene' normalisation method that is used in the GeneRain paper
    - I can just use the function in the github
- He had another suggestion regarding the use of transformers however this is likely something that will not be able to done in my timeline 

### Merfish Dataset
I was able to download a merfish dataset from Vizgen directly, this dataset needed to be requested from their website as part of their data release progam. The dataset downloaded was the following 
- *Vizge Merfish Mouse Brain Receptor Map*
    - data request form is available at the following site https://info.vizgen.com/mouse-brain-data
